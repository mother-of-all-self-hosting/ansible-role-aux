# aux is a role that manages auxiliary files and directories on your server.
#
# Certain components may sometimes require additional files and directories created on the filesystem.
# This role allows such files to be managed by the playbook.
#
# Note that files and directories created via this role are not automatically made available for containers to use.
# If you use this role to put files in a directory that's already mounted into a container,
# you can access the files without additional work.
# Otherwise, you'd need to mount the file/directory to the container that needs it.
# Roles usually provide an `*_additional_volumes` or `*_container_extra_arguments` variable
# that you can use to mount an additional volume.

# The default directory permission mode when creating directories using `aux_directory_definitions`
aux_directory_default_mode: '0750'

# The default directory owner when creating directories using `aux_directory_definitions`
aux_directory_default_owner: root

# The default directory group when creating directories using `aux_directory_definitions`
aux_directory_default_group: root

# Holds a list of directories to create on the server.
#
# By default, directories are:
# - created with permissions as specified in `aux_directory_default_mode`
# - owned by the `aux_directory_default_owner` user and `aux_directory_default_group`
#
# Example:
#
# aux_directory_definitions_host:
#   - dest: /some-directory
#
#   - dest: /some-directory/another
#     mode: '0700'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'
aux_directory_definitions_host: []
# this var is for playbook- or group-level definitions, and should not be used in specific host's `vars.yml`
aux_directory_definitions_auto: []
# this var is cumulative of `aux_directory_definitions_host` and `aux_directory_definitions_auto`
aux_directory_definitions: "{{ aux_directory_definitions_auto + aux_directory_definitions_host }}"

# The default file permission mode when creating files using `aux_file_definitions`
aux_file_default_mode: '0640'

# The default file owner when creating files using `aux_file_definitions`
aux_file_default_owner: root

# The default file group when creating files using `aux_file_definitions`
aux_file_default_group: root

# Holds a list of files to create on the server.
#
# By default, files are:
# - created with permissions as specified in `aux_file_default_mode`
# - owned by the `aux_default_owner` user and `aux_default_group` group
#
# You can define the file content inline (in your `vars.yml` file) or as an external file (see the example below).
# Defining the content inline in `vars.yml` has the benefit of not splitting your configuration into multiple files,
# but rather keeping everything inside `vars.yml`,
# which also gets backed up on the server in `/../vars.yml` if the `com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_state_preserver` role is used.
#
# Note: parent paths for files must exist.
# If you've defined a file with a destination of `/some/path/file.txt`,
# then you likely need to add `/some/path` to `aux_directory_definitions` as well.
# You don't need to do this for directories that the playbook already creates for you.
#
# Use a `content` key for text content and `src` with a location to a file for binary content.
# The `content` key does not support binary content (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/11594).
#
# Example:
#
# aux_file_definitions_host:
#   - dest: "{{ some_config_dir_path }}/something.html"
#     content: |
#       <!doctype html>
#       <html><body>Something</body></html>
#
#   - dest: /aux/some-other-file.txt
#     content: "Something"
#     mode: '0600'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'
#
#   - dest: /aux/yet-another-file.txt
#     content: "{{ lookup('template', '/path/to/file.txt.j2') }}"
#     mode: '0600'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'
#
#   - dest: /aux/binary-file.dat
#     src: "/path/to/binary.dat"
#     mode: '0600'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'
